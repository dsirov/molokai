# Molokai Color Scheme for Vim

Molokai is a Vim port of the monokai theme for TextMate originally created by Wimer Hazenberg.

By default, it has a dark gray background based on the version created by Hamish Stuart Macpherson for the E editor.

256-Color terminals are also supported, though there are some differences with the Gui version. Only the dark gray background style is supported on terminal vim at this time.

## Installation

Copy the file on your .vim/colors folder.
